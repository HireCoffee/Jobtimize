# How to use ?
Since `Jobtimize` is a package, in python you just have to import it.
The main function (*for now*) is `Jobtimize.jobscrap`.
```python
from Jobtimize import jobscrap

df = jobscrap(["Data Scientist", "Data Analyst"],
              ["UK", "FR"]
    )

df.head()
```
The `df` object is a dataframe pandas, so it inherits all its methods.
